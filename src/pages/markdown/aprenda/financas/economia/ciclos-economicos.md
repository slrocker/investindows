##O que é a economia?

Tudo começa com uma troca.

Trocas são parte integrante da natureza humana e de nossa sociedade. Não temos a capacidade de, sozinhos, produzir tudo o que precisamos para sobreviver e ter uma vida agradável. Trocas são uma solução a este problema pois, ao entregarmos algo que possuimos em troca de algo que sentimos necessitar mais do que o objeto entregue, encontramos uma forma de ultrapassar nossos limites e obter o que queremos.

Transações feitas com dinheiro também são trocas.  Você troca o seu tempo por um salário e troca o salário por comida. O dinheiro é apenas **um meio troca** que facilita as conversões, evitando que tenhamos que calcular quantas galinhas valem um transatlântico.

Em tempos antigos, dinheiro poderia também representar riqueza, pois tinha alguma utilidade intrìnsica além de servir como moeda de troca. Por exemplo, especiarias ou metais valiosos tinham outras utilidades práticas além de servirem como dinheiro em transações.


Hoje em dia, nos tempos de **moeda fiduciária escritural** (dinheiro sem lastro físico), o dinheiro não possui nenhum valor próprio, é apenas um papel emitido pelo governo cuja utilização como moeda é baseado em:

- Leis que obrigam os cidadãos a aceitá-lo; e
- A confiança das pessoas em seu funcionamento.

Entender que **dinheiro não é riqueza** é essencial para compreender os ciclos econômicos.


**Riqueza são os bens e produtos que utilizamos para tornar nossa vida melhor.** O dinheiro escritural é apenas uma forma de ter acesso à riquezas.

Várias pessoas que fazem trocas com o mesmo tipo de bem geram um **mercado**. Ao citarmos o **mercado financeiro** estamos nos referindos àquelas pessoas que negociam ativos financeiros como a ações, cotas de fundos etc.

A junção dos diversos mercados forma a economia.

##Crescimento Orgânico

Como o ser humano é capaz de evoluir ao longo do tempo, inventando novas máquinas e processos de produção, ele consegue produzir mais produtos e oferecer mais servições de maneira mais rápida e eficiente utilizando os mesmos recursos de antes. 

Essa evolução faz com que haja um crescimento da riqueza produzida ao longo do tempo.

Tendo em mente que a riqueza são os bens e serviços produzidos, poderíamos chegar ao seu valor somando tudo o que foi produzido em uma economia.

O cálculo do Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) de um país é uma maneira de tentar fazer isso. O PIB considera apenas os bens e serviços finais da economia (o último bem produzido), ou seja, tomando como exemplo um carro, o PIB ignora os processo de fabricação do metal, da borracha, do vidro etc. e computa apenas o valor do carro.

A despeito das [diversas críticas](https://www.mises.org.br/Article.aspx?id=2783) o PIB é a fórmula mais utilizada atualmente para se medir a rqieuza produzida.

Se plotarmos os valors do PIB em um gráfico ao longo do tempo, poderemos ver o crescimento de longo prazo que citamos (Figura 1):

##Crédito

É comum que existam:

- Pessoas que tenham dinheiro sobrando; e
- Pessoas que precisem de dinheiro imediatamente mas não o possuem.

Essas duas pessoas podem fazer uma troca, que conhecemos como **operação de crédito**, onde alguém empresta dinheiro a outra pessoa em troca de receber o mesmo valor acrescido de um valor extra (juros) no futuro.

É importante notar que o crédito pode ser utilizado para duas coisas:

- Financiar o consumo; e
- Financiar um empreendimento.

###Crédito para Consumo

Imagine uma pessoa que quer comprar um bem de consumo — um bem que não vai ser utilizado para fabricar outros bens — tal como uma televisão ou um carro.

Se esta pessoa não possui o dinheiro necessário no momento da compra, ela tem duas opções:

- Poupar o dinheiro; ou
- Pegar dinheiro emprestado.

No caso da poupança, a pessoa terá de sacrificar algum consumo no presente para conseguir juntar o dinheiro e consumi-lo no futuro.

No caso do empréstimo, a pessoa estará adiando o seu sacrifício de poupar para o futuro, quando o empréstimo terá de ser pago.

O aumento temporário do consumo propiciado pelo crédito pode gerar uma falsa impressão de riqueza, porém, como nenhuma riqueza adicional foi produzida, a única forma de pagar o empréstimo será através da redução do consumo no futuro.

Se desenhasemos o gráfico do consumo dessa pessoa ao longo do tempo, veríamos que ele naturalmente forma um ciclo, pois há um período de aumento no consumo propiciado pelo crédito e um momento de redução nos gastos, quando o crédito deve ser pago (Figura 2).

###Crédito para Investimento

Imagine um empreendedor que tem o plano para executar um projeto mas não dispõe da quantia total necessária para colocá-lo em prática. 

Se o empreendedor acreditar que o empreendimento será capaz de gerar riqueza suficiente no futuro para pagar o empréstimo e os juros, será viável pegar dinheiro emprestado e utilizá-lo na sua empreitada.

O empreendedor utilizará o crédito para adquirir bens de capital — um bem utilizado para produzir outros bens — tais como máquinas industriais, tratores etc.

Suas compras elevarão temporariamente o seu nível de consumo, que, no futuro, terá de ser reduzido para que ele possa pagar o empréstimo. No entanto, sua produçao de riqueza terá aumentando em relação ao período inicial e ele se verá em uma condição de consumir mais do que antes (Figura 3).

##Ciclos de Crédito

Como vimos, a existência de crédito tende a gerar pequenos ciclos de consumo para aqueles que pegam dinheiro emprestado. Em um sistema de trocas como o nosso, a despesa de alguém sempre será a receita de outro.

Dessa forma, à medida que o crédito aumenta o poder de consumo das pessoas ele também aumenta a receita daqueles que vendem produtos para essas pessoas. Essa nova receita permite que os vendedores também possam gastar mais. Com todo mundo tendo condições de gastar mais ocorre um aumento geral da demanda por bens e produtos. A partir daí, duas coisas podem acontecer:

- **Se o crédito financiar investimentos na produção**: haverá uma tendência de aumento da oferta de produtos e uma tendência dos preços se manterem controlados; ou
- **Se o crédito financiar apenas o consumo**: haverá um excesso de demanda sem aumento da oferta, o que tende a aumentar o preço dos bens disponíveis.

###Ciclo de Crescimento

Com o aumento da procura por bens e serviços e a elevação do seu preço, as pessoas que possuem bens passam a ter mais disponibilidade de crédito — a análise de concessão de crédito consiste em avaliar a capacidade de pagamento da dívida o que inclui renda e bens que a pessoa possui.

Da mesma forma, como há um aumento dos gastos e todo gasto de alguem é a receita de outra pessoa, a renda das pessoas tende a aumentar, melhorando ainda mais sua capacidade de conseguir crédito.

Dessa forma, inicia-se um ciclo de crescimento econômico em que o acesso ao crédito se torna mais fácil, há mais consumo, mais empregos são criados e a renda da população aumenta.

###Pico de Crescimento

Até onde pode ir o crescimento financiado pelo crédito?

Imagine um sistema econômico onde a quantidade de dinheiro fosse finita.

Nesse sistema, para que exista crédito é preciso que, antes, alguém tenha poupado dinheiro. Se todos gastarem tudo o que ganham ninguém terá dinheiro para emprestar.

No início do ciclo de crescimento, havia uma quantidade de dinheiro disponível para crédito e os juros se encontravam em um patamar baixo.

Á medida que a poupança existente vai sendo emprestada, o dinheiro disponível começa a reduzir e os juros cobrados começam a aumentar. Isso reduz a demanda por crédito e causa uma desaceleração no ciclo de crescimento. As pessoas agora já não conseguem pegar dinheiro emprestado e precisam começar a cortar gastos.

###Ciclo de Recessão

Como os gastos de uma pessoa são a receita de outra pessoa, com a redução do consumo e corte de gastos a renda das pessoas começa a diminuir. O consumo e a demanda por bens e serviços se reduz. Começa a ocorrer uma dificuldade no pagamento de empréstimos. Algumas pessoas dão calote, outros precisam renegociar as dívidas. Com a redução da demanda e da renda, algumas fábricas fecham e o desemprego aumenta.

Ocorre um reajuste da economia para patamares mais adequados de endividamento e poupança, até que o crédito se torne disponível a juros mais baixos e o processo de crescimento se reinicie.

Quanto mais liberdade tiverem os agentes econômicos para se reajustarem, isto é, quanto mais fácil for vender bens que se tornaram desnecessários, renegociar dívidas, se realocar em outro emprego etc. mais rápido será o ciclo de recessão.

Além disso, se o crédito tiver sido adequadamente utilizado para aumento da produção, o nível de riqueza geral terá aumentado e a tendência é que o equilíbrio se dê em patamares melhores do que os que existiam anteriormente.

##Governo e Bancos

As pessoas não gostam dos inevitáveis ciclos de recessão. Queda na renda, redução do consumo, aumento do desemprego, extinção do crédito, tudo isso é desagradável.

Boa parte das teorias econômicas em voga, especialmente as que apoiam a interferência do governo na economia, defendem que, com os ajustes finos necessários, a economia poderia seguir em rumo de crescimento equilibrado onde recessões virariam coisa do passado.

Assim, o governo tomou para si o monopólio sobre a criação do dinheiro e o poder de controlar o crédito, através da manipulação das taxas de juros.

A partir daí, os ciclos de crédito passaram a ser controlados pela [política monetária](/aprenda/financas/economia/politica-monetaria) do governo, a qual é exercida através do Banco Central.

**Crescimento**

Quando o governo quer estimular o crescimento, reduz a [taxa de juros](/aprenda/financas/economia/taxa-selic). Na prática, redução da taxa de juros significa que o Banco Central ["imprime" mais dinheiro](/aprenda/financas/economia/sistema-bancario) e disponibiliza esse novo dinheiro para os bancos, os quais, por sua vez, passam a ter mais poder de conceder crédito, aumentando o crédito disponível.

O crédito criado pelos bancos atua como um aumento da oferta de dinheiro, permitindo que as pessoas consumam mais, novos investimentos sejam iniciados etc.

Inicia-se um ciclo de crescimento.

**Inflação**

Grande parte do crédito criado pelo sistema bancário é utilizado para financiar o consumo. Com o aumento da demanda sem que haja aumento da oferta de bens e serviços, ocorre um aumento [generalizado dos preços](/aprenda/financas/economia/inflacao).

Um aumento generalizado fora de controle pode ter consequências nefastas para a economia, por isso, para evitar a catástrofe, o Banco Central aumenta a taxa de juros e enxuga o crédito disponível.

Com menos crédito disponível as pessoas precisam reduzir seu consumo e vender bens para quitarem suas dívidas. Isso gera um desaquecimento da economia e uma queda no preço dos bens e serviços.

**Recessão**

Com a redução do consumo e o aumento dos juros, empreendimentos que antes pareciam viáveis se tornam inviáveis, empreendedores tem de cortar gastos, fechar fábricas, vender equipamentos, enfim, é a temida recessão que acaba ocorrendo mesmo com as interferências governamentais.

Assim que as coisas começam a se mostrar mais controladas, o Banco Central inicia uma redução da taxa de juros, reiniciando os ciclos.


<div class="borderBox">

<h4>Inflação Eterna</h4>

A oferta monetária é quantidade de dinheiro em circulação. De maneira simplificada, podemos dizer que a oferta monetária é soma de todo o dinheiro e crédito em circulação.

Como o governo está constantemente aumentando a disponibilidade da oferta monetária (figura 4) com a intenção de tentar pagar os seus déficits e controlar os ciclos, porém a produção de novos bens e serviços não acompanha esse aumento, o resultado tem sido um lento e contínuo aumento dos preços ao longo do tempo.

<p class="legenda" style="text-align:center">Figura 4 - Evolução do M1 de dez/01 até set/19 (em milhões de R$). Fonte: Banco Central.

Observe a figura 4. Ela mostra a evolução do M1 (uma forma de medir a quantidade de moeda existente) sazionalizado (corrigindo as variações atípicas que ocorrem, por exemplo, nos períodos de final de ano) no período de dezembro de 2001 até setembro de 2019. Neste período, o M1 variou de R\$68,5 bilhões para cerca de R\$380 bilhões, um aumento de cerca de 5,5 vezes.

A inflação medida pelo IPCA para esse período, de acordo com a [calculadora do cidadão](https://www3.bcb.gov.br/CALCIDADAO/publico/corrigirPorIndice.do?method=corrigirPorIndice) foi de aproximadamente 240,00%.

**Longo Prazo**

Se a oferta de crédito fosse restrita pela poupança disponível, os ciclos econômicos teriam um "freio" natural que limitaria o crescimento pela disponibilidade de dinheiro poupado e o aumento da renda das pessoas através de incrementos na produção de bens e serviços.

No entanto, como o governo tem o poder de criar dinheiro, a quantidade de crédito tornou-se, na prática, ilimitada, estando restrita apenas às análises técnicas realizadas pelo Banco Central em sua tentiva de atingir um equilíbrio ideal.

O que ocorre é que, à medida que os juros vão baixando, pessoas que tomaram crédito emprestado, ao invés de pagarem suas dívidas, simplesmente pegam mais dinheiro emprestado para quitar suas dívidas anteriores e poderem manter seu nível de consumo elevado.

Ou seja, a cada fim do ciclo de recessão, de maneira geral, as pessoas estão mais endividadas do que estavam no ciclo anterior, o que cria um ciclo de endividamento de longo prazo.

##Ciclos de Longo Prazo

Através da manipulação das taxas de juros, o Banco Central cria ciclos de crédito de curto prazo. No entanto, a cada fim de ciclo, a economia acaba terminando com mais crédito do que existia anteriormente.

O crescimento da produtividade, da renda e dos preços permite que esse ciclo de crescimento se prolongue por um longo tempo, criando o ciclo de crescimento de longo prazo.



###Bolha

É comum que boa parte do aumento de crédito seja financiado devido ao aumento da capacidade de pagamento das pessoas. Variação positiva no valor dos salários e dos bens utilizados como garantias em empréstimos (tais como os imóveis, ações, etc.) permite às pessoas irem se endividando de maneira crescente.

Isso acaba gerando um ciclo vicioso em que o crédito é utilizado para adquirir os bens que estão se valorizando, aumentando a demanda e o preço e permitindo às pessoas adquirirem mais crédito para comprarem mais bens visando ganhar com o aumento no preço dos mesmos. Esse comportamento acaba gerando uma **bolha**, onde o preço dos bens perde qualquer relação com a realidade e torna-se insustentável.

Cedo ou tarde, o crescimento do crédito começa a superar o aumento da produtividade, bens ficam muito caros, empresas começam a falir, o desemprego aumenta e as pessoas começam a ter dificuldade em pagar suas contas.

Começa uma corrida pela venda de bens para tentar levantar dinheiro, o que acaba gerando uma queda rápida no preço, destruindo o patrimônio das pessoas.

###Desalavancagem

Com o estouro da bolha, começa um doloroso processo de desalavancagem, isto é, o crédito tem de ser reduzido de alguma forma.

Em muitos casos, as pessoas simplesmente não tem como pagar suas dívidas, precisando renegociá-las ou simplesmente deixando de pagá-las.

O dinheiro torna-se escasso pois as pessoas não tem mais os requisitos necessários para tomar empréstimos e aqueles com dinheiro para emprestar se tornam mais exigentes.

No ciclo de desalavancagem a velha tática do Banco Central de baixar os juros não surte efeito, ninguém quer emprestar dinheiro ou tem condições de pegar emprestado. É comum que as taxas de juros cheguem a 0,00% ou fiquem até mesmo negativas. 

O ciclo de desalanvacagem é como um choque de realidade na economia que, depois de passar anos crescendo sem fundamentos, precisa retornar a uma relação mais adequada entre riqueza e crédito.

###Crise Bancária

Ciclos de desalavancagem são especialmente nocivos para os bancos. Por operarem sempre com a liquidez restrita devido ao sistema de [reservas fracionárias](/aprenda/financas/economia/sistema-bancario), à medida que os bens que compõem os seus ativos começam a reduzir de preço e os calotes aumentam, os bancos passa a não ter como garantir o pagamento de suas próprias obrigações — tornando-se insolventes — e declaram falência.

Quando um banco declara falência, todo o dinheiro das pessoas que estava depositado nele é retido para pagar os credores. Isso gera uma corrida das pessoas aos bancos para retirarem seu dinheiro antes que mais bancos se vejam em apuros e seja tarde demais. A situação dos bancos fica ainda mais complicada e o resultado pode ser uma crise catastrófica no sistema financeiro.

É comum que o governo interfira e utilize dinheiro publico para financiar os bancos que estão em dificuldade, evitando uma crise no sistema inteiro.

Críticos apontam que essa intervenções são apenas uma forma salvar os banqueiros que, mesmo sabendo dos riscos envolvidos, se alavancaram demasiadamente (obtendo muito lucro com isso) e, quando a crise vem cobrar pelos riscos assumidos, é o contribuinte quem tem de pagar a conta. Os verdadeiros responsáveis saem mais ricos e incólumes, sem qualquer tipo de punição ou incentivo para que não cometam o mesmo erro no futuro.

##Críticas

###Prolongamento dos Ciclos

Grande parte das teorias econômicas intervencionistas — que pregam a manipulação econômica pelo governo — têm como base  a ideia de que o governo deve atuar de forma a minimizar os impactos negativos dos ciclos de crédito.

Críticos dessas teorias apontam que é justamente a interferência governamental quem tem tornado os ciclos cada vez mais catastróficos e duradouros:

- Através do sistema de reservas fracionárias e do foco excessivo no consumo, o Banco Central acaba criando crédito muito além do que seria possível em condições livres, gerando distorções na economia que se prolongam por muito tempo sem que haja as correções necessárias; e
- As constantes intervenções econômicas e o excessivo peso das contas públicas sobre a riqueza produzida tornam o sistema engessado e sem margem para que haja uma correção rápida nos ciclos de recessão e desalavancagem, prolongando esses ciclos de maneira desnecessária, gerando um grande sofrimento para a população.

No longo prazo, a sociedade acaba pagando caro pelas intervenções, pois a economia segue estagnada sem que haja crescimento real de produtividade e riqueza.
