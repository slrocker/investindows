Basicamente, há duas maneiras de se ganhar dinheiro investindo em Fundos de Investimento Imobiliário (FII):

- Através da participação no lucro; e
- Na valorização do preço da cota.

##Participação no Lucro

Legalmente, os FII devem distribuir aos seus cotistas quase a totalidade (95%) de todo o lucro que apuram em suas operações em um semestre.

Na prática, isso faz com que os FII distribuam rendimentos aos seus cotistas de maneira periódica (a grande maioria o faz mensalmente).

Além disso, muitos admnistradores se esforçam para fazer as distribuições serem equilibradas ao longo do tempo, sem que haja grandes variações.

Esses fatos fazem com que os FII gerem uma renda periódica aos seus cotistas, que podem utilizar o dinheiro para consumo ou para novos investimentos.

O lucro dos FII pode ser oriundo de:

- Contratos de locação;
- Venda de imóveis e ativos valorizados; e
- Rendimentos de investimentos financeiros.

O quanto o FII será lucrativo dependerá de fatores como:

- Valores de locação;
- Valores de negociação dos ativos;
- Taxas obtidas nos investimentos financeiros; e
- Taxas a serem pagas ao admnistrador do FII.

##Qual o rendimento dos Fundos de Investimento Imobiliário?

Como é possível estimar com relativa facilidade e alto nível de acerto o fluxo de pagamentos futuros de um FII, com o aumento da liquidez das cotas dos fundos, o mercado tem adotado uma postura de considerar os FII como uma espécie de renda fixa com riscos elevados.

Assim, **as cotas de FII acabam sendo precificadas de forma que os rendimentos distribuídos ofereçam uma rentabilidade  equivalente a algum indíce de remuneração de renda fixa acrescido de um prêmio**.

Por exemplo:

- Se a renda fixa paga em média 10% ao ano;
- A cota de um FII será precificada de forma que os valores distribuídos gerem um rendimento de 10% + prêmio ao ano, por exemplo 12%.
- Se a renda fixa passar a pagar em média 5% ao ano;
- As cotas subirão de preço, de forma que os valores distribuídos gerem um rendimento de 5% + prêmio ao ano.

O valor do prêmio irá depender das características de cada FII.

Observe na figura 1 abaixo como o IFIX (índice que avalia a movimentação geral no preço das cotas de FII) tem uma movimentação inversa à [taxa SELIC](/financas/economia/taxa-selic), que é uma taxa de referência para remunerar títulos de renda fixa.

<p class="legenda" style="text-align:center;">Figura 1 - Movimentação inversa do preço das cotas (IFIX) e a taxa SELIC (entre 03/2013 e 03/2019). Supondo que os valores distriubídos pelos FII permaneceram inalterados, o preço das cotas sobe de forma a manter o rendimento obtido pelo investidor próximo ao da taxa SELIC + prêmio. Fonte: <a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/Aprenda-Investir-em-Fundos-Imobiliários-ebook/dp/B07WJYKLYX/">Aprenda a Investir em Fundos de Investimento Imobiliário</a> por Eric Dornelas.</p>

##Valorização da Cota

Como a cota dos FII representa um pedaço do patrimônio do fundo, é de se esperar que, à medida que o patrimônio do FII aumente, o preço de cada cota acompanhe essa valorização.

Obviamente, esse movimento só será percebido a longo prazo, quando as flutuações de curto do prazo nos preços são diluídas e o preço tende a acompanhar os fundamentos de cada FII.

O crescimento patrimonial do FII pode ser oriundo de:

- Valorização nos ativos que compõem o seu patrimônio; e
- Compra de novos ativos.

No entanto, como os FII tem de distribuir a maior parte do lucro e não podem se endividar, é raro que algum FII consiga alcançar crescimento significativo que realmente impacte no seu patrimônio.

Por isso, a maior parte dos FII lança mão de [novas emissões](/renda-variavel/eventos-acionarios/emissao-follow-on) de cotas para poder crescer.

Outra dificuldade nesse ponto é o fato de que os FII precisam reavaliar anualmente o valor de cada ativo que possuem. Como essa avaliação é feita levando-se em conta fatores que se alteram dependendo das condições econômicas, é comum que o patrimônio do FII aumente em épocas de crescimento econômico, onde a aavaliação dos seus ativos é mais positiva e se reduza em épocas de crise, onde as avaliações se tornam mais pessimistas.

Devido a essas questões, **a expectativa é que o valor patrimonial dos FII**, supondo que não haja novas aquisições ou aspectos que degradem o valor dos ativos do fundo, **reflita a tendência dos imóveis de apenas acompanhar a inflação ao longo do tempo**.

No entanto, não se deve levar isso como regra, pois sempre haverá casos em que o FII pode valorizar ou perder valor devido a fatores como:

- Melhoras na economia;
- Aumento da procura pelos imóveis do fundo;
- Contratos de aluguel fechados a preços diferenciados; e
- Alterações na localidade dos imóveis.

###Fundos de Papel

Fundos de papel são aqueles cujo [mandato](/renda-variavel/fundos-imobiliarios/tipos-de-fii) consiste em investir em títulos e valores mobiliários.

Nesses fundos, o valor patrimonial da cota tende a:

- Manter-se estável ao longo do tempo; ou
- Reduzir-se ao longo do tempo.

Isso ocorre porque esses fundos distribuem aos seus cotistas não só o rendimento auferido nos ativos financeiros, como também a correção inflacionária que remunera os títulos.

Por exemplo:

- Um FII investe R\$100.000,00 em um CRI cujo rendimento é de 10% ao ano mais a correção do IPCA (IPCA+10);
- O patrimônio inicial do FII é R\$100.000,00.

Supondo que após um ano o FII receba os 10% de rendimento mais uma correção do IPCA de 5%:

- O FII terá um patrimônio de R\$115.000,00.

Digamos que o FII distribua 100% do lucro auferido no período. Serão distribuídos R\$15.000,00 em rendimentos aos cotistas.

- O FII terminará o com os mesmos R\$100.000,00 de patrimõnio que tinha anteriormente.

No entanto, devido aos efeitos da inflação, R\$100.000,00 hoje já não tem o mesmo poder de compra de um ano atrás. Houve, portanto, uma desvalorização patrimonial do FII.

###Fundo de Fundos

Da mesma forma que nos fundos de papel, os fundos de fundos acabam distibuindo como lucro a correção inflacionária que tende a ocorrer no preço das cotas que ele negocia.
